    "# Assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "In this exercise we will be trying to predict the electrical usage of the boole library on a particular day based on a number of factors, including the opening hours, footfall, heating degree days and number of hours of daylight.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have two datasets - for 2012 and 2013. They contain the opening hours, footfall, heating degree days and daylight hours for a number of days in each year for the Boole library. 2012 includes the electrical usage for each day, whereas 2013 does not.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, you'll investigate the 2012 data and build a correlation matrix to see what it looks like.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will then build a regression model from the 2012 data. First, you'll need to split the data into training and testing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, you will need use cross validation on the training data to train a number of models with different degrees of polynomial features.\n",
    "\n",
    "The best performing feature set will then be used to build the final model on the full set of training data. This will be then evaluated on the held-out test set, to give an accurate r2 score. You can plot the predictions against the actual values to see how they look.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you determine the model is performing well, you use it to predict electrical usage for 2013. You can then compare the two datasets and see why they differ.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NB: This assignment is changed slightly every year. Do not copy and paste from last year'. You will be found out.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Important Note\n",
    "Any code you will need to fill in will be marked with a comment **next** to it. Other comments above code do not necessarily mean you need to adapt that code, they are just there to explain what's happening. E.g., in the code below, the first line does not need to be altered, but the second line you'll need to name your model.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# get the training data:\n",
    "X_train = X[train_indices]\n",
    "\n",
    "# name the model\n",
    "= LinearRegression() # name the model here\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Report\n",
    "\n",
    "You are required to produce a final report which should include the following:\n",
    "1. Introduction – Brief introduction including the objectives of the assignment and relevance of data analytics for the analysis and improvement of building energy performance.\n",
    "2. Correlation matrix for the 2012 Dataset – Comment on the results.\n",
    "3. Show that cross validation was performed using regression on a number of polynomial features. Give the average score across the folds for each polynomial degree. **This corresponds to section 5 below, not section 4**.\n",
    "4. Build the final regression model using the best feature set. Include the intercept and weights for this model in your report (copy & pasting directly from the notebook is fine).\n",
    "5. Evaluate the final regression model on the test set. This should be done with a scoring metric and a useful plot. Comment on your findings.\n",
    "8. Make a prediction for the electricity usage of the Boole library in 2013 based on footfall, daylight hours, opening hours and heating degree days. Discuss your result and compare with the electricity consumption for 2012. Discuss why there may be differences or similarities. The comparison stage of this may be done in python or Microsoft excel (see section 6.2 for details).\n",
    "9. Brief discussion and conclusion on the overall results achieved in the assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You may find the headings and questions below useful in framing the various sections of your report. Note that answering these questions is not mandatory; they are merely prompts for discussion. Final report should come in around 10 pages.\n",
    "* Why do we separate training and testing data?\n",
    "* What is the purpose of cross validation?\n",
    "* Are our 2013 predictions accurate?\n",
    "* What are heating degree days? Why would they have/not have an effect on the electricity usage?\n",
    "* Did the model improve much from using the base set of features (i.e. polynomial degree 1) to higher degree polynomials? Why might thei be the case?\n",
    "* Check the validity/sanity of data, common sense approach, state all assumptions and rationale behind the same\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will serve as the basis for the analysis of the Boole Dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Using Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "Jupyter is a _notebook_ development environment for python. If you've used mathematica before, you'll be familiar with the notebook concept.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each cell (like this one) can either be for _code_ or _markdown_ (a very basic language for formatting text). This cell is a markdown cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "Clicking in the `typing` area of a code cell will let you enter edit mode on that cell. Pressing ctrl+Enter will run the code in that cell. Keyboard shortcuts can be found by clicking on help -> keyboard shortcuts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please note that any variable created in the code can be viewed by typing `print(variable)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are allowed to copy and paste or otherwise edit some of the code in the housing notebook to apply it to your own datasets if you are not comfortable writing from scratch. As well as this, 99% of errors or anything else you are having trouble with can be solved by a quick google. In particular, the the [cross-validated](http://stats.stackexchange.com/) and [stack-overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) stack exchange sites are great resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to load the Jupyter notebook\n",
    "1. Open Chrome and go to https://notebooks.azure.com\n",
    "2. Sign in with your UCC IT account. If you can't remember this, but have a microsoft/hotmail account, you can sign in with this. Otherwise, you'll need to create an account.\n",
    "3. Click on \"Libraries\" in the top left\n",
    "4. Click on \"New Library\", then click on \"From GitHub\"\n",
    "5. The GitHub Repo is https://github.com/lkev/ce3010_lab\n",
    "6. Give it the name \"CE3010 Lab FirstName LastName\" (with your actual name, not FirstName LastName)\n",
    "7. Give it the ID ce3010-firstname-lastname\n",
    "8. Click Import\n",

    "The notebook you'll be using during the class is \"Houseing - Partially Filled\".\n",
